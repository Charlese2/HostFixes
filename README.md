# Host Fixes
Server-Side Anti-Cheat mod.
Trying to keep it compatible with mods if the host has the mods that others use.

- Checks the player that server RPCs are called from to prevent spoofing actions from other players.
- Added a few cooldowns.
- Allows you to log player damage.
- Option to disable player damage on the ship.

You can toggle some of the checks in the config if you need to.
